I'm trying out this coding thing because I want to learn to do stuff on the digital realm.
I'm currently learning Python and R (I have a prticular interest in data analytics). However, I'm also interested in learning in learning lots of other stuff.
I find it really easy to read about development-related stuff, but I sometimes struggle with execution. This GitHub account is a way to get me started doing stuff.
